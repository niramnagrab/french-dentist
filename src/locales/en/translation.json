Then, we will supply you with professional-grade whitening agents, which you will apply to your trays based on the instructions provided by our dentist. Most patients will use take-home whiteners for 2-3 weeks. The end results of take-home whitening are the same as an in-office whitening, but the process is more subtle. We perform an initial consultation before any whitening treatment to ensure that you are a suitable candidate and discuss options available to you.",

Once you are comfortably settled into our chair, pick your favorite TV show, your gums will be covered with a special gel and a whitening agent will be applied to your teeth. The procedure usually last an hour. A relief gel will be applied to your teeth and we will review with you what food and beverages to stay away from for the next few days….and yes, we know, coffee is on that list! But, don’t worry, it’s only temporary! Brief sensitivity may occur to even the most non-sensitive people, but will not last long. Brushing with toothpastes like Sensodyne will help, as well as staying away from foods at both extremes in temperatures for the next few days. Get your sunglasses on. It’s time to shine!"
