  "part988": "What is orthodontics?", 
  "part989": "Some people seem to do everything right when it comes to their oral health. They have the best at-home oral hygiene routine, visit the dentist every 3 months for regular cleanings, and generally have a healthy smile. But even with that, they may have crooked and misaligned teeth.  Proper alignment of teeth is not only important for aesthetic reasons but it also contributes to your oral health. It’s easier to clean between your teeth when they are evenly spaced and not crowded. This helps prevent cavities and gum disease more effectively because it makes proper oral hygiene much more simple. Also, correcting your bite can help protect your teeth from damage. If you have an overbite or underbite, the improper tooth contact could result in premature wear and tear on your teeth. Orthodontic treatment helps prevent teeth grinding and chipping of the teeth.", 
  "part990": "Why is orthodontic treatment needed?", 
  "part991": "There are three primary reasons you may need orthodontic treatment, and they’re all closely related. First, you may need orthodontic treatment if you have serious bite problems, also known as “malocclusion.” Bite problems such as an overbite, underbite, crossbite, or open bite can cause a lot of different problems like speech impediments, difficulty chewing properly, and premature wear & tear to the teeth. They can also negatively affect your appearance. Underbites, for example, cause your jaw to protrude more than normal. The second reason is due to misaligned teeth. Even if you have no serious bite issues related to your jaw, you may have crooked or crowded teeth that do not fit together properly. Again, this can negatively affect your appearance, but it also affects your oral health. For example, very crooked or crowded teeth can be hard to clean, leading to a higher risk of cavities and gum disease. Finally, some people may choose to get orthodontic treatment merely as a way to improve their appearance. Teeth that are slightly crooked or uneven may not cause any major oral health issues, but still may make you feel self-conscious about how you look, so this is a completely legitimate reason to get orthodontic treatment.",
